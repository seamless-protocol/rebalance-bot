## Slack Alerts
Slack alerts can be emitted by setting the following environment variables:
- `SLACK_ALERT_CHANNEL_ID`: Slack channel ID that the alerts should be published to
- `SLACK_AUTH_TOKEN`: OAuth token for a Slack App with permissions to write in the channel

See [here](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for information on setting up a Slack App.
